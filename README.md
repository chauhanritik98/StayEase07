### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gher.com.git
   ```

   `Unzip the File`

2. **Open with VS Code**

   Open the project directory with VS Code or your preferred code editor.

3. **Install Dependencies**

````

**Frontend:**

- Navigate to the frontend directory:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
````

- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

  ```env
  VITE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
  VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
  VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
  VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
  VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
  VITE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
  VITE_BACKEND_URL = your_backend_url (http://localhost:4000)
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

**Backend:**

- Navigate to the backend directory:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```

- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

  ```env
  PORT=4000
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
  NODE_ENV = development
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## 4. **Update API URLs**

Ensure that the API URLs in your frontend code are correctly pointing to your local backend server. Update the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in the `.env` file (as mentioned in the previous step).

## 5. **Access the Application**

After everything is set up:

- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.
- Ensure the frontend loads correctly and communicates with the backend server.

## 6. **Deployment**

- Deploy the frontend to Vercel and the backend to your preferred hosting service.
- Ensure the environment variables are properly set in the respective hosting platforms.
